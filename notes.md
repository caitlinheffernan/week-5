# Notes
**Sonification**
* Google Trends for search term "Facebook" from 2004 to present, in US and Worldwide
* originally was going to use Canada instead of US but the trends for Canada and Worldwide were very similar, comparing with US is a bit more interesting
* chose piano and violin because similar range but very different sounds, easy to compare
