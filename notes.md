# Notes
**Sonification**
* Google Trends for search term "Facebook" from 2004 to present, in US and Worldwide
* originally was going to use Canada instead of US but the trends for Canada and Worldwide were very similar, comparing with US is a bit more interesting
* chose piano and violin because similar range but very different sounds, easy to compare

**Maping**

**Posters**
* Wasn't a fan of the pre-made templates (seems very "internet in 2010" aesthetic) but I wasn't comfortable trying to make one from scratch
* I was a bit frustrated overall with Inkscape. It felt like I could make something better lookign in Microsoft Word (I'm sure this isn't the case if I knew how to use it properly but I had a lot of resizing/colouring/font issues)
 * I made half a poster before giving up on trying to change the template

## Errors

* http://0.0.0.0:8000/ doesn't work
  * http://localhost:8000 instead
